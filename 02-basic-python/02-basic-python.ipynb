    "You don't need a graphical interface, a mouse or a touch interface, to interact with a computer. Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are the much older way of interacting with computers. And while most casual computer users won't need to use a command line interface today, as soon as you start programming you will likely encounter CLIs on a regular basis. They can be very powerful and even easier to use for some tasks. \n",

    "```\n",
    "fdf@ubuntu:~$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "This tells us that we're running as user `fdf` and are currently in the directory `~`. Here `~` refers to your user's home directory, so it's a shorthand for `/home/fdf` for my specific computer and my specific username. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `$` is called a [command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt), and indicates that you can enter a command. Common prompt symbols are `>`, `%`, and `#`; there really is no difference between these variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what you're doing on a command line is run little applications or commands. For example, we can run the `ls` application inside the folder that contains this notebook: \n",
